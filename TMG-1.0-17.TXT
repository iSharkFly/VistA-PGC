Run Date: 11/22/10		     Designation: TMG*1.0*17
Package : TMG - FAMILY PHYSICANS OF GREENEVILLE  Priority: ROUTINE
Version : 1       SEQ #17                       Status: Released
=============================================================================

Associated patches: None

Subject:  1. Adds pediatric growth charts into an unmodified CPRS (as well as TMG-CPRS)
	  2. Provides Text Objects to access percentiles for pediatric height, weight,
               head circumference, and BMI

Category:  New features in CPRS (all work in unmodified CPRS)

Note: This is a replacement for TMG Kids patch Version 1.0  Seq 16. This includes an update of the
      javascript library to version 2.3 and corrects a few bugs that existed in Seq 16 (e.g. Labels 
      for tic marks on graphs and proper plotting of points).

Description:
============

  1. PEDIATRIC GROWTH CHARTS:
	After installation of this patch, graphic pediatric growth charts will be added as a 
	report on the REPORTS tab in CPRS.  (This does NOT require TMG-CPRS to work.) It 
	makes use of VA standard HTML type reports.  The internal text of the report includes
	javascript code that graphs out pediatric patient data.  
	NOTES:
	-- For pediatric patients, both HEIGHT and LENGTH must be stored in the
	   HEIGHT field.  For the purpose of these graphs, it has been assumed that for
	   age < 2 yrs, that  "HEIGHT" is actually a length. (HEIGHT is a standing stature,
	   while LENGTH is measured with patient laying flat on table.)
	-- Head circumference measurements must be stored as a CIRC/GIRTH type vital.
	-- To print out graphs, right click on the graph and select PRINT from the context
	   menu.
	-- We have paid the $99 license fee to the author of the javascript library, and
	   the author (Josh Gebelein) has assured me that this covers all users of our 
	   open source release.
	-- We have tried to create installer code that inserts our growth charts report
	   in a manner that does not disrupt other reports.  However, if a site has a 
	   unforseen setup, then a CAC may have to edit this manually:
		1. Navigate to Fileman menu option XPAR EDIT PARAMETER
		2. Choose: ORWRP REPORT LIST
		3. Move the entry for TMG GROWTH CHARTS to the appropriate section
			for your site.

  2. TEXT OBJECTS TO INCLUDE PERCENTILES
	Text objects are smart objects that can be dropped into templates in CPRS.
	When used, they contact the server and return appropriate information.  E.g.
	|PHONE NUMBER| would return the patient's telephone number.

	The following text objects have been created. They will include a percentile
	for the measurements (the same percentile that would show up in a growth chart)

        TMG PATIENT BMI                                                         
        TMG PATIENT HC                                                          
        TMG PATIENT WT  
        TMG PATIENT HT   

	E.g.  |TMG PATIENT HT|  resulted in this output 
	(07/12/2010 @ 10.5 yr) Ht 53 in [134.6 cm], 13rd %tile
	The date is only added when the vital measurement date is different from the 
	note date.

          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global

  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TMG1-1.0-17

  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//'
      respond NO.

  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and

      appropriate path.  E.g. /tmp/TMG1-1.0-16.KIDS

       1      Load a Distribution
       2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       3      Print Transport Global
       4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
       5      Backup a Transport Global
       6      Install Package(s)
              Restart Install of Package(s)
              Unload a Distribution

  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TMG*1.0*16
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global

  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TMG*1.0*16
